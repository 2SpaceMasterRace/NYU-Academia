== Abstract

These are notes for **CS-GY 6043: Design and Analysis of Algorithms II**, a graduate-level
course at New York University, taught by Aaron Bernstein in Fall 2025.

This course is a continuation of Algorithms I and focuses on advanced techniques
for designing and analyzing algorithms, with strong emphasis on formal proofs,
problem-solving strategies, and mathematical rigor.

*Course description:*  
The course introduces several core tools and topics in modern algorithm design,
while further developing algorithmic problem-solving skills. Topics include
amortized analysis, potential functions, data structures such as Union-Find,
NP-completeness and reductions, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms,
and sublinear algorithms. If time permits, additional topics such as linear
programming rounding and randomized rounding are covered.

== Course Prerequisites

Prior completion of **CS-GY 6033 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms I)** or an
equivalent course is required. This includes familiarity with asymptotic analysis,
recurrence relations, standard sorting and searching algorithms, dynamic
programming, and fundamental graph algorithms.

Students are also expected to be comfortable with basic discrete mathematics,
including proof techniques (especially induction), graph theory, logarithms, and
elementary probability. A high level of mathematical maturity is required, as
nearly every algorithm discussed must be accompanied by a correctness proof.
