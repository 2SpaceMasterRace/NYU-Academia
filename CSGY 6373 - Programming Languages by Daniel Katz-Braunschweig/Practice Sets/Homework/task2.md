TASK 2:
The Caesar cypher is a simple cypher algorithm where each letter is assigned another letter in the alphabet.  A table of corresponding letters is generated and stored.  Your table will be stored in a associative array which you will access.

Create an associative Array in which one character is mapped to another character  Make sure no character is represented twice in either the keys or the values.  for example you can use: $map= array ('a' => 'q');  not all characters must be represented!

1) Using the same format as above, your program will be run with an input filename and an output filename in the form of "php myprog.php 2 input.txt output.txt" (2 is the task number).  Your program should read in the file and if any letters match those in the key of the array, they should be replaced with the corresponding letters in the value.

2) If the file contains a character which is not present in the array, you should leave the character alone.

Your file must be named in the form of first initial/last name then the number 1.  Mine would be dkatz1, other examples are jsmith1, jdoe1, etc.  You will submit the single php file here.
