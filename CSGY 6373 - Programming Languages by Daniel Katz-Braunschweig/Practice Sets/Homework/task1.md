TASK 1:
We're going to write a program which implements a very simple (almost useless) cypher algorithm.  The algorithm works by adding the number 13 to every letter and (with wrapping so that 'Z'+1='A') will result in a new letter.  Numbers are increased by 5 with wrapping so they remain just one digit. Other characters are left untouched.

Your code must meet the following restrictions
