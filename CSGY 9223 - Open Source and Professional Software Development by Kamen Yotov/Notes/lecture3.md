# Introduction to Teamwork
1. You never work alone
2. Team is a group of people with a share objective but different roles 
3. Cynefin framework 
    3.1. Simple: writing binary search
    3.2. Complex: Finding bugs
    3.3. Complicated: Staff management, bugs in systems
    3.4. Chaotic: AWS going down
    3.5. 3-D model, it's a cliff where simple can fall into chaotic: Amazon layoffs
4. Study finds most of swe is reading code and talking to people, something students don't focus on
5. Give sound reason why what the constraints are, the easier it is to align to see what can and cannot build along the timeline -- be very clean with estimates , understand the real objective
5.1. Escalate if they don't agree with the data, talk to someone senior but remember risks are involved -- come up with multiple options, why something is preferred
6. Agile is Waterfall in disguise, but waterfall cannot be a part of agile such as integrating user experience studies 
7. If the work is not defined, and we don't have more engineers - run
8. Amazon's rule of thumb - team should be no bigger than one induvidual member getting 2 slices of pizza
8.1. Large people needs more communication and it becomes the gossip protocol i.e. people spend all their time talking 
9. Have a code of conduct to avoid storming, have a social contract written in text - things like ground rules, behavouir, etc  
10. High Performance team traits - Good communication(Avoid that number of people vs communication cuttoff *8.1.) and motivation(are people interested in the work they're doing?)
10.1. How people are selected also depend on high performance of a team 
10.2. Roughly 3 ways to select a team - Randomizaiton, Leadership selected (Engineer Manager based on assessment and what the team requires), and Self-Selected (Empolyee joins a team based on their interests)
10.3. Self Selected teams perform better in eyes of customer, motivation highly decides how people work
10.4. High visiblity is super stressful, aim for steady paced projects with not much distracitons
10.5. People always knows better and more honest with themselves 
10.6. Most people spend time just thinking about themselves, each report gets only 2% of the attention if they get 10 reports. It depends on how much they like/hate the person.
10.7. Self selected long term teams perform better than leadership selected teams

# TODOs:
1. Your teams will be small (3-4 members)
2. Break up large work items into smaller independent tasks (Common Goal)
3. Agree on roles and responsibilities. (Roles and responsibilities)
4. Who will coordinate the meeting(s)
5. Who will write the team update(s)
6. Who will keep track of progress(s)
7. Review each other’s work and provide feedback. (Interdependence)
8. Remember your teammates from this semester might very well be your future colleagues!

# Misc notes 
1. How do you get good at estimates?
2. Read Mythical Man-Month
3. Ask about work life balance and what time is good to come and early, advice on joining a new team and how to build a good relationship with a manager
