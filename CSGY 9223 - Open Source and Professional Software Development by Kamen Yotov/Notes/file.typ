== Abstract

These are notes for *CS-GY 9223 / CS-UY 3943: Open Source and Professional Software
Development*, a combined graduate and undergraduate course at New York University
Tandon School of Engineering, taught by Professor Kamen Yotov in Spring 2024.

This course focuses on aspects of software development that are rarely emphasized
in traditional coursework but are central to real-world professional and open-source
software development.

*Course description:*  
The course surveys the full software development lifecycle as practiced in both
open-source communities and corporate environments. Topics include product
discovery, requirements gathering, proposal writing, design, implementation,
testing, deployment, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning. The course
also examines different project types and the various roles software engineers play
throughout the lifecycle.

== Course Structure and Objectives

Each lecture is organized into three main components:
1. Material covering a specific stage of the software development lifecycle.
2. Presentation of an open-source project idea, which feeds into homework
   assignments.
3. A “war story,” often delivered as a guest lecture, where industry practitioners
   discuss real-world experiences that contrast with academic expectations.

The primary objectives of the course are:
- Exposure to all phases of the software development lifecycle.
- Experience working in multiple software engineering roles.
- Hands-on contribution to open-source projects across different domains.
- Interaction with and learning from experienced industry professionals.
- Preparation for professional software development after graduation.
