== Overview

These notes correspond to *CSGY-6003: Foundations of Computer Science*, a graduate-level
course at New York University. The course provides a rigorous introduction to the
mathematical foundations underlying modern computer science, with emphasis on
formal reasoning, abstraction, and correctness.

The material emphasizes precise definitions, proofs, and models that are essential
for advanced study in algorithms, programming languages, systems, and theory.

*Course focus includes:*
Discrete mathematical structures, logic, proof techniques, automata and formal
languages, computability, and an introduction to computational complexity.

== Course Description

This course develops the mathematical tools required to reason formally about
computation. Students learn to construct and analyze proofs, define formal models,
and understand the theoretical limits of computation.

Core topics include:
- Propositional and predicate logic  
- Sets, relations, and functions  
- Proof techniques (induction, contradiction, invariants)  
- Finite automata and regular languages  
- Context-free grammars  
- Turing machines and computability  
- Decidability and reducibility  
- Introduction to complexity theory  

The course serves as a foundation for further work in algorithms, programming
languages, operating systems, and theoretical computer science.
